# Project status

Last updated: 26 October 2026.

## Decided

- **Framing (16 October 2026).** The paper is a measurement and gradient-resolvability paper with a new title.
  - The Langevin apparatus moves to its own track.
  - Stage 4 stays in the paper as the falsified hypothesis.
  - See [`principal/QLO_Principal_Track.md`](principal/QLO_Principal_Track.md) §1.
- **Novelty audit A1, generalisation A2, normalisation A3, positioning A4.** See the principal track, §§2–5.

## Open

1. **Principal review of the propositions** in `docs/theory/A2_PROPOSITIONS.md`. They answer principal §6 item 4;
   the principal track decides the final wording.
2. **A5:** the update to QuIP Network, kept out of this public repo.
3. **Manuscript** under the decided framing. B4 adds a noise section: the identity and the slope rule survive, and
   doubling depends on the noise model.
4. **Optional extensions** (B4 §8): local noise on entangling circuits, other channels, two noisy SWAP copies.

## Known notes

- Principal §6, B1 bullet, writes b_SWAP = b_LE − b_S. §3 derives b_SWAP = b_LE + b_S. B1 tested the plus form, and
  the data agree (B1 §3).
- B5 remaining holes: APS versions of Teo 2023 and Mari 2021, a full read of Sulimov & Lehmann 2026, library
  databases (B5 closure audit §8).
