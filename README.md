# qlo-research — Stage 1: experimental foundation

## Research question

Can finite-shot measurement noise — normally treated as a limitation of
variational-quantum-algorithm (VQA) optimization — act as *useful* stochastic
exploration, e.g. Langevin-style diffusion, in regimes where gradients are
otherwise vanishingly small ("barren plateaus")?

**Stage 1 (this repository state) does not attempt to answer that.** It only
builds and verifies the minimum trustworthy foundation on which that question
can later be studied: a reproducible ansatz, controlled local/global costs,
verified gradients, deterministic seeding, and a pipeline smoke test.

## What is established vs. hypothesized vs. not claimed

**Established (background, not tested here):**
- Finite-shot quantum measurements produce statistical estimator noise in
  expectation values and therefore in gradient estimates.
- Some VQA architecture/cost-function combinations exhibit barren plateaus
  (gradient variance that decays exponentially with qubit count).
- Stochastic / Langevin dynamics produce exploratory behaviour in optimization.

**Hypotheses to test (in later stages, not here):**
- Shot noise may improve exploration in a *verified* barren-plateau regime.
- The covariance structure of shot noise may generate a useful effective
  diffusion for the parameters.

**Not claimed (and must not be assumed by anything in this repo):**
- That shot noise is fluctuation–dissipation-theorem (FDT) noise.
- That any "QLO" method escapes plateaus in polynomial time.
- That QLO is superior to existing optimizers.
- Any quantum advantage.
- That the ansatz here universally exhibits barren plateaus, or that there is a
  universal qubit-count threshold for them.

## Circuit

Hardware-efficient ansatz, `depth` layers of

    RY(θ[l,q,0]) RZ(θ[l,q,1]) on every qubit q, then CNOT entangler

- parameter tensor shape: `(depth, n_qubits, 2)`
- parameter count: `p(n, depth) = 2 · n · depth`
- entangler: `"ring"` (CNOT(q,q+1) for q<n−1, then CNOT(n−1,0)) or `"chain"`
  (open nearest-neighbour line)

## Cost functions

| name     | observable                    |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| `global` | `Z_0 Z_1 … Z_{n-1}`           |
| `local`  | `(1/n) Σ_i Z_i`               |

Both are exposed through `qlo.get_observable(name, n_qubits)` and consumed by
`qlo.make_cost(ansatz, name, diff_method)`.

## Gradients

Analytic `default.qubit` (`shots=None`) only. Three paths, all returning the
parameter-tensor shape:

- `gradient_autograd` — backprop through the state-vector simulator (reference)
- `gradient_parameter_shift` — two-term shift rule; the estimator that will be
  reused unchanged on finite-shot devices later
- `gradient_finite_difference` — central differences on the scalar cost;
  independent of PennyLane's gradient machinery

Tests require autograd and parameter-shift to agree to `1e-10` and autograd and
finite-difference to `1e-6`.

## Setup

```
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -e ".[dev]"
```

(Or any Python ≥ 3.12 venv + `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.)

```

The smoke experiment is a pipeline test only. Its numbers are not evidence
about barren plateaus. Stage 2 (see `STAGE2.md`) characterizes finite-shot
*estimator noise* only. Stage 3 (see `STAGE3.md`) reproduces a controlled
literature barren plateau on a separate benchmark; the hardware-efficient ansatz
has structural zero gradients with the global cost and is not that benchmark.
Stage 4 (see `STAGE4.md`) tests whether finite-shot stochasticity helps escape that
verified plateau: it does not (null at matched learning rate; indistinguishable from
covariance-matched Gaussian noise; large classical diffusion helps only for n ≤ 8).
Stage 5 (see `STAGE5.md`) explains that result exactly: the finite-shot estimator is
`(K₋ − K₊)/(2M)` with binomial counts whose success probabilities sum to `A_k`, so the
shots needed for a non-zero estimate or unit SNR grow like `1/A_k` — typically `4^{n−1}`.

Stage 6 (see `STAGE6.md`) asks whether every finite-shot barren plateau fails that way. A global
Pauli-parity cost on the same circuit needs the same ≈ `4^n` shots, but its shifted outcome
probabilities sit near ½ instead of near 0. So `P(ĝ=0)` stays at `≈ 1/√(πM)` for every n, and the
estimator fails by random signs instead of by exact zeros. The difference persists at matched |g|.
Novelty is unconfirmed (see the Aghaei Saem et al. 2026 note in `STAGE6.md`).

Stage 7 (see `STAGE7.md`) removes Stage 6's landscape confound. The same fidelity, gradient and θ are read
out two ways: a Loschmidt/projector measurement or a SWAP test. The failure modes survive (exact zeros vs
random signs), and the readout alone changes the gradient shot exponent: median ≈ `4^n` (Loschmidt) vs
≈ `16^n` (SWAP). SWAP-driven GD at n ≥ 10 is indistinguishable from a signal-free random walk, which
replicates known prior work. Novelty is unconfirmed (Thanasilp et al. 2024; Aghaei Saem et al. 2026).
